### INTRODUCTION 
Brain tumor detection stands as a critical frontier in modern medical diagnostics, given its profound impact on patient prognosis and treatment planning. With brain tumors affecting a substantial number of individuals globally, the timely and accurate identification of these abnormalities is imperative for effective intervention. Leveraging the intricate capabilities of deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and pretrained models like VGG16, our project endeavors to revolutionize brain tumor detection methodologies. By harnessing the detailed information provided by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans and employing advanced data preprocessing techniques, we aim to develop a robust and precise system capable of automating tumor segmentation and detection. This introduction sets the context for our research, highlighting the pressing need and the promising potential of our approach in enhancing the diagnostic accuracy and efficiency of brain tumor detection.
